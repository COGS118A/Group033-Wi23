    "# Abstract \n",
    "The criteria of whether a game is recommended or not has been quite subjective and confusing, therefore, the goal of our project is to create a relatively objective universal model to estimate the quality and popularity of a new game, and determine whether it is recommended or not. The data of the dataset represents multiple criterias of the games, and some of the data are categorical (boolean), including the supported systems and rating(positive/negative), and the rest of the data are statistical, which includes the total counts of user reviews, the positive ratios of the games, the initial and final prices of the games, and the discounts that were offered. We will be using the algorithms that were learned in class, and we will divide these data into a training set (validation set), and test set to create and train our model to fit as closely as possible to the dataset, and we will use this model to estimate a new game. Finally, the performance will be measured using the f1 score.\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like what we have mentioned above, the input of our data includes two major categories â€” categorical variables and statistical variables, hence our solution/model needs to include several algorithms in order to take both of these variables into account when deciding whether the game is recommended or not. We will be using one-hot encoding for the categorical variables(boolean), which means we will transform the data such as the supported system of the game. Then we will add the sum of the variables for each row, since each row represents a game. This will determine the games that are most adaptive, since the higher the sum is , the most systems it could be implemented on. Then, we will be using linear regression to tackle the statistical variable, which means we will use the linear regression to test the correlation between the rating scales and the ratio. The correlation will be acted like a decision boundary in order to determine the threshold of the positive ratio that could be classified as positive rated games(mostly positive, very positive etc.). Then we will create a model that combines these two algorithms, and the model would be a binary classification model, which means it could be used to determine whether a game is recommended or not. After creating the model, we will use a game that was not in the dataset and takes the specs of the games back into our model to test the accuracy. Moreover, the metric that we will be using is F1 score, which is a metric that is used to determine the performance of a binary classification model.\n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric that we chose is the F1 score, as we learned in the class, the F1 score is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, which fits our model(the intended solution) perfectly, since we are trying to generate a model that could classify either a game is good or not, and unlike other metrics, F1 scores takes both precision and recall into account, which means it is the most balanced metric among them. This is important in our case, since the false positives and false negatives are equally important. False positives in this case represents the game that is actually bad but is classified as a good game, which would increase the potential buyers of the game, and also increase the potential financial loss to the buyers since the game might not be worth buying; and the false negatives indicate that the game is actually a good game but the model classified it as a bad game, which would cause financial loss to the companies since less people would be buying the game. Therefore, the F1 score would be the best option since it could tell us how the model is performing based on these two factors(FN and FP). The mathematical representations of this metric is F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall), and the metric is derived from the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n"
